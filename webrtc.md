Need of RTC - <br>
When we want server to be automatically updated when we need
Ex - Mobile app and Website updated when one is added Ex-Notion, DOcs<br>

<h2>Ways to solve this</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Use a polling system to send empty HTTP request every few seconds(But not optimal) </li>
  <li>Use Web Sockets</li>
  <li>Use WebRTC(Persistent connection between server)- When  connection is created first request is always HTTP</li>
</ol>
